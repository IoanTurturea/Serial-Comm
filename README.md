# Serial-Comm

A application made for general serial UART communication. 

The app can read and send data on serial interpreted as:
string, int(decimal), int(hex), int(binary)
The communication is fully configurable from the GUI.
In background Log file is filling with all the communication datas.
Also the user can save prefered configurations for future use.

GUI made with Windows Forms. Although now I prefer WPF.
