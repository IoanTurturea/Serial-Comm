# Serial-Comm

An application made for general serial (UART) communication. 

The app can read and send data on serial interpreted as:
string, int(decimal), int(hex), int(binary)
The communication is fully configurable from the GUI.
In background Log file is filling with all the communication datas.
Also the user can save preferred configurations for future use.

GUI made with Windows Forms, using .NET and C#. 
Although now I prefer WPF.
Try it by downloading and running the Setup.exe file.
